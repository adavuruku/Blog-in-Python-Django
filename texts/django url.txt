project url.py

urlpatterns = [
    
	url(r'^admin/$', admin.site.urls),
	url(r'^myproject/$', include('myproject.urls')),

]

explain 

r - where the must start all url

'^admin/$'
^ - the begining of the url
admin/
$	-	it terminates it implies nothing should come after that

example
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/	-	correct
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/me	-	is wrong because the url terminate at admin/$

same explanation goes to ^myproject/$

example
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/myproject/	-	correct
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/myproject/me	-	is wrong because the url terminate at admin/$

further the second url is including another url which implies that the url should goes to another file to search for its proper interpretaion

include('myproject.urls')	-	myproject is my app name and urls is the urls.py in app

so every url that hit the browser with just http://127.0.0.1:8000/myproject/ will go to my app urls.py to look for the view to rendere

while the ones only with this http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ will go to django admin page

****************
app url.py
*****************

app name myproject
	urlpatterns = [
	url(r'^viewAll/(?P<category>\w+)/$', views.view_All, name='view_All'),
	url(r'^readNews/(\d+)/$', views.read_post, name='read_post'),
	url(r'^new/(\w+)/$', views.new_post, name='new_post'),
	url(r'^$', views.post_list, name='post_list'),
]

this where the project url is directing you to

r'^viewAll/(?P<category>\w+)/$'

myproject/viewAll/{anyother string values}

it takes the string value as a string parameter to its class in view

url(r'^viewAll/(?P<category>\w+)/$', views.view_All, name='view_All'),

views.view_All

a class in views.py is know as viewAll that accept the string parameters

valid  http://127.0.0.1:8000/viewAll/sam/

	incorrect: http://127.0.0.1:8000/viewAll/
		or http://127.0.0.1:8000/viewAll/sam/jude

anything after viewAll/ is taken as a url parameter
